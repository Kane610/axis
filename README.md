## Initialization architecture

Vapix initialization is phase-based and driven by handler metadata:

- `API_DISCOVERY`: handlers initialized after API discovery.
- `PARAM_CGI_FALLBACK`: handlers that may initialize from parameter support when not listed in discovery.
- `APPLICATION`: handlers initialized after applications are loaded.

Handlers declare phase membership through `handler_groups` and may customize phase eligibility through `should_initialize_in_group`.
